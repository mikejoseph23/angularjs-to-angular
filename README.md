# angularjs-to-angular
A tool I built in helping me port an AngularJS application using Bootstrap 3 to an Angular (ngx) application using Angular Material.

Built with DotNetCore...

I have a few AngularJs Applications here and there. While they served me well, it's time to move into the times and get them up to date with the Angular (ngx) platform. I wrote this program to help me with a lot of the "grunt-work" associated with porting AngularJS to Angular (2/4/5/6/xxxxx).

NOTE - This program is meant for my own personal use and is meant to be handy. It's far from perfect, but did a good job with what I designed it to do, which was to eliminate much of the search-and-replace work needed to replace AngularJS / Bootstrap code and markup into Angular / Material Design code and markup.

Documentation on this program is non-existent as of now, but if anyone is intrigued by this project or needs help, that could change.
